Why Engineering? The First Step Toward My Tech Career
If you're in 12th right now with MPC (Math , Physics, Chemistry) and feeling confused about your next step — trust me, I’ve been there. I was torn between two very different paths: CA (Chartered Accountancy) and Engineering. One involved numbers, audits, and finance. The other promised logic, technology, and creation.

It wasn’t just a battle between careers — it was a battle of fears, interests, and long-term dreams. Looking back, choosing engineering was one of the best decisions I made — and in this blog, I want to share why, and how my journey might help you if you're standing at a similar crossroads.

My Confusion After 12th – CA or Engineering?
After completing 12th with MPC, I had no clear answer to the question: What now?

Since I had strong math skills, CA seemed like a stable and respected option. But deep down, I had doubts — especially about whether I’d actually be able to clear all those levels. I had heard how tough and unpredictable the CA path could be.

“What if I don’t pass the exams? What if I get stuck halfway with no backup?” These thoughts scared me.

On the other hand, engineering was something I didn’t fully understand yet — but it excited me. I was curious about technology, apps, coding, and how things work behind the scenes. The fear with engineering was: “What if I’m not good at it?”

I was confused — stuck between fear of failure and fear of the unknown.

What Helped Me Decide
I started talking to seniors, watching videos, and reading blogs from people in both fields. I didn’t look for which career made more money — I looked for which one matched my interests and had more flexibility.

That’s when it hit me:

CA felt risky — not just because of the difficulty, but because I wasn’t passionate about it.

Engineering felt uncertain — but exciting. And it opened many paths: software development, web design, data science, blogging, and more.

I realized that even if engineering was hard, I’d enjoy the journey. And that made all the difference.

My First Steps into Engineering

When I joined engineering, it was definitely challenging at first. I struggled with programming. My first “Hello World” felt like a big achievement!

But slowly, I started enjoying it. I explored coding platforms, watched tech tutorials, and even started building mini projects. Each small win gave me confidence that I was in the right place — even if I wasn’t perfect at it.

The best part? I was growing. Not just in knowledge, but in confidence.

Advice If You’re Still Confused
If you're someone still confused between CA and Engineering — or any two paths — here's what helped me:

Don't choose out of fear. I almost picked CA because I thought it was “safe.” But in reality, it wasn’t safe for me, because I wasn’t passionate about it.

Choose what excites you. Even if it's hard, if you're curious about it, you'll find a way.

Think long-term. Where do you want to see yourself in 5 years? What kind of work life do you imagine?

It's okay to not know everything right now. You grow and learn as you go.

How Engineering Aligns With My Goals
Now, I want to build a tech career — maybe as a software developer, a UI/UX designer, or a tech content creator. Engineering is giving me that launchpad. It’s flexible, creative, and full of opportunities.

It also taught me something more valuable: how to keep going when I feel stuck.

Final Thoughts
Choosing engineering over CA was a bold move for me — and not everyone agreed with it. But I followed what felt right for me, not what others expected.

So if you're reading this, confused, scared, or under pressure — take a deep breath. Listen to yourself. Don’t choose something just because it seems safe or because others say it's “best.” Choose what you’re willing to work hard for. Choose what sparks your interest.

Because that’s the path that leads to not just a career — but a life you’ll actually enjoy living.
