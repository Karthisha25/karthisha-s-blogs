In my second year of BTech, we had a lab called RTSR (Real Time Societal Research), where we were asked to work on a project that solves a real-life problem. As part of this lab, I got the chance to do my first proper team project — and it turned out to be one of the best experiences in my college life so far.

Our team, made up of only girls, decided to work on a project called Scheme Navigator. The idea behind this project was to help people find both government and non-government schemes they are eligible for. We wanted to build something that could be genuinely helpful — especially for people who are unaware of the schemes available to them based on their age, income, education, and other details.

At the beginning, we were excited and confident. But once we started working, we realised how challenging it actually was. From understanding the requirements, collecting correct data, designing the interface, to writing and connecting the backend code — it took a lot more time and effort than we expected.

I was mainly responsible for the backend and database part of the project. I used Python and MongoDB to store scheme data and build the filtering logic. There were times when things didn’t work, when errors kept coming, and when I felt stuck — but I never gave up, and I learned something new every day.

What made this journey truly special was my amazing team of girls. We supported each other, stayed up late fixing bugs, and kept pushing ourselves even when things got tough. We laughed through the stress, divided tasks smartly, and celebrated the small wins together. It was not just about coding — it was about friendship, growth, and teamwork.

In the end, we completed Scheme Navigator successfully, and it became more than just a lab project for us. It was our first real experience of working like a team in the tech world. I will always remember this project — not just for what we built, but for the strong bond we shared as a team of girls taking on a challenge together.
