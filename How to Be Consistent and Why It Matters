How I Learned the Secret of Consistency
A while ago, I told myself,
“I’m going to start reading every day.”

Day 1 : I read 20 pages.
Day 2 : I read 15 pages.
Day 3 : “I’m tired… I’ll read double tomorrow.”
Day 4 : You can guess what happened… the book started collecting dust.

It wasn’t that I didn’t like reading. The problem was, I thought progress came from doing a lot at once. But real progress comes from doing a little every day.

The Pizza Slice Lesson
Imagine you have a whole pizza. You don’t eat it in one bite (unless you have superpowers). You take it slice by slice.

Consistency works the same way. You don’t have to finish the whole “goal” in one go. Just do a small part every day, and it adds up.

Why It Works
When you do something every day:

You improve without even noticing.

It feels easier because it becomes part of your routine.

You don’t keep “starting over” again and again.

It’s like brushing your teeth you don’t think about it, you just do it.

My Simple Trick
Instead of reading 20 pages a day, I decided to read just 5 pages.
It was so easy, I didn’t have an excuse.
Some days I read more, but never less than 5.

After a while, reading became a habit like having my morning tea.

The Takeaway
Big changes don’t happen overnight. They happen in small, repeatable steps.

So pick your “pizza slice” reading, writing, drawing, learning something new — and do it every day.
One day, you’ll look back and say,
“Wow… I actually made it happen.”
